# python-calculator_version2-advanced which does the same thing as the first version but I 
used my functions and it makes my program good and clean. I also keep track of the calculations 
made so that if the user chooses to quit the program it will return all the made calculations
and the times the user did operation either division, addition, or multiplication. Thanks
