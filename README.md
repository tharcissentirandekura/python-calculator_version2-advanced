# python-calculator_version2-advanced which does the same thing as the first version but this i 
used my functions and it makes my program good and clean. I also keep track of the calculations 
made so that if the user choose to quit the program it will return all the made claculations
and the times the user did operation either division, addition, or multiplication. Thanks
